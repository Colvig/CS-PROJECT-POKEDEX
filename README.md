# Gen 1 Pokedex for Python 3.9.7

This project requires four files. There is a ```pokedex.py``` and a ```pokestats.txt``` along with two mp3 files ```laketheme.mp3``` and ```selecteffect.mp3```. These all need to be downloaded into the same folder in order for this to run. 

Open the folder in VSCode making sure you see the text file, the python file, and the two mp3 files on the left.

Tkinter is needed. To install Tkinter through VSCode navigate to the terminal and type ```pip install tk```.

This project also requires PIL and pygame. In the same terminal as before type ```pip install pillow``` for PIL,
and ```pip install pygame``` for pygame.

Once both of these are installed you should be able to press run and the podedex will open.
